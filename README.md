# Regression
I am implementing simple and linear Regression model 
In this model, we will predict the salaries of employees. Here, we have a data set of employees. the data set contains the data of 30 employees. which is split into a 1/3 ratio of training and testing data i.e 20 data will be used in training set and 10 data will be in the test set.

for a better understanding of the model, we have also visualized the training and the test graph separately in the code.
